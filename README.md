# COMP3610-Project
The repository provides the code for ingesting and investigating the “Airbnb prices in European Cities” dataset, to provide predictive outcomes based on the features within the dataset using Jupyter Notebook and various python technologies. The predictions made by the investigation would aid new Airbnb hosts when adding new listings on the Airbnb site as well as clients looking for a satisfactory location to stay.
